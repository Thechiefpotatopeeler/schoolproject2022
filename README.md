# schoolproject2022

My school project for CSC112 in 2022

The development of the game is done solely by me (Thomas Andrew Jackson/Rhyw/Thechiefpotatopeeler/Rhyw_SSCLI) however I have used APIs/libraries from other programmers, in this case the Howler JS library and the (unimplemented) MySQL API along with their dependencies.

The graphics of this game are done by me with INSPIRATION from certain public domain fonts. The music for this game is also done solely by me and is available on my spotify (T.A. Jackson II).
